Project made in class based on the week's lesson.

Given main() and the Coin struct, complete function CountHeads() in main.c that counts and returns the number of flips taken to achieve a desired number of heads. Function CountHeads() has a Coin struct and an integer representing the desired number of heads as parameters. Review the Coin struct in "Coin.h" and the function implementations in "Coin.c" uploaded to module 7. A starter main.c is also uploaded.

Note: For testing purposes, a Coin struct is created in the main() function using a pseudo-random number generator with a fixed seed value. The program uses a seed value of 15 during development, but when you demo your code to your TA, use a different seed value for each invocation.

Ex: If the Coin struct is created with a seed value of 15 and the desired number of heads is 20, then the function CountHeads() returns 40 and the program outputs:

    Total number of flips for 20 heads: 40
Develop your multiple source file (Coin.h, Coin.c, and main.c) program using the Eclipse or VSCode IDE. 

Demonstrate your program to your TA during your laboratory session who will then assign you a grade in Canvas.
