# CompE160-Projects

Each branch contains both the instructions for the projects I created in class as well as the working code that I created to fulfill all requirements of the project guidelines. 

Some projects were similar to the ZyBooks challenge activities or LABS that were added into my other Repositories under the respectful names, but some were not. Regardless, all shown projects were built upon the previous weeks' new information so as to ensure solidification of the previous and current lesson materials.
