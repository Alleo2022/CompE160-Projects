Projects made in class based on the week's lesson

The classic and first book on C programming is The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, published in 1978.  
In chapter 1, Brian Kernighan proposes “the only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.  
The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words hello, world”.  

Some trivia: many books on computer programming will have you print, as a first programming exercise, the message "Hello, World!", with capital letters and an exclamation mark.  

For this first laboratory exercise, we will do it Kernighan’s way and print “hello, world” without capital letters or an exclamation mark.  
In addition, you will append your name and SDSU REDID number to the output. I have uploaded file hello.c to Canvas that prints only “hello, world”. Your task is to modify this program and print: hello, world my name is fistname lastname and my redid number is 123456789
    Of course, substitute fistname lastname and 123456789 with your personal information.
You are to implement this program using either the Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers with the Cygwin GNU GCC toolchain, or Visual Studio Code with the C/C++ for Visual Studio Code extension, as discussed in class. If you have a laptop, please install the Eclipse IDE using the directions provided during your laboratory session.
If you look at the file hello.c uploaded to Canvas, you will see a comment block at the top of the file. This comment block has several fields that define or describe, in plain English, the program title, author, purpose, required program input and output, algorithm, and other pertinent information. You are to use this comment block as a template for all laboratory programming exercises.

Demonstrate your program to your TA to receive credit for this programming assignment.
